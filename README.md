# denorun
Simple Deno project config/run script

It works but is not very robust atm.

Written in python and includes a --install command line flag that "should" work on linux but hasn't been tested.
This is more of a proof of concept than anything in reponce to the Deno issue at https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/1431 with the yaml based on the syntax created by mauritzn at https://gist.github.com/mauritzn/04d8a6e910d6612356d4daf231c7a6d1
